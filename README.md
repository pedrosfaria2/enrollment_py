FastAPI-based enrollment management system with RabbitMQ message processing.

## Documentation

Complete API documentation available in the `documentation/` folder. Open `documentation/index.html` in a browser.

Additional documentation includes:
- `documentation/requirements/` - Application requirements
- `documentation/diagrams/` - System diagrams and charts

When running the application, interactive API documentation is available at:
- `/docs` - Swagger UI
- `/redoc` - ReDoc

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- uv (Python package manager)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- make
- ruff (linting and formatting)

## Setup

```bash
make setup
```

This installs dependencies and sets up the project in editable mode.

An `.env_example` file is provided for configuration reference. For testing, copy it to `.env` in the root directory.

## Running

### Local Development
```bash
# API server
make run

# Worker/consumer
make run-worker
```

### Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all services (API + Worker + RabbitMQ)
make run-compose

# Run with logs visible
make run-compose-logs

# View logs from running services
make compose-logs

# Stop services
make stop-compose
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Using Makefile
make test
make test-coverage
```

## Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code
uv run ruff check .

# Lint and fix issues
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Using Makefile
make lint
make lint-fix
make format
make check  # runs both lint and format
```
